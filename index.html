                <h2>About Me</h2>
                    <p>My name is Colin Clothier and I'm a student at Algonquin College studying <abbr title="Interactive Media Design">IMD</abbr>. I am 20 years old and was born on May 21<sup>st</sup> 2002. I was born and raised in Canada and have lived here all my life. Some of my hobbies include playing video games, listenting to music, and playing basketball.</p>
                    <p>What I plan on achieving in this program is mastering all the skills from all the classes, and getting a job when i finish the program. I am <em>very</em> excited to be in this program as it is something i've been interested in for a while. I always messed around photography, programming, and digital graphics in the past on my own so I'm really excited to properly learn them.</p>
